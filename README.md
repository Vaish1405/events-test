# ðŸ§ª Accessible Events Carousel (Temporary Test Repo)

This temporary repository is used to develop and test **ARIA-compliant accessibility fixes** for the events carousel component.

Once the accessibility updates are finalized and approved, this implementation will be migrated to the official repo.

## âœ¨ What's New?

- Fully integrated **WAI-ARIA carousel pattern** based on the official [ARIA Practices Guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/carousel/)
- On **arrow key navigation**, only the **event title** is announced by screen readers
- On **tabbing into an event card**, the **full event details** are read aloud
